# Web-Application-Security

## Objective
The purpose for practicing and studying website application security is to protect web applications and their underlying systems from weak and insufficient code. Protecting a website and web application from weak code will assit in preventing some of the most common web application attacks that are listed in <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/">OWASP Top Ten Web Application Security Risks.</a> 

### Skills Learned
- Securing code against web attacks including the following.
  - Injection
  - Broken Authentication
  - Sensitve Data Exposure
  - XML External Entity (XXE)
  - Broken Access Control
  - Security Misconfiguration
  - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
  - Insecure Deserialization

#### Example Assignment
Image 1 is a example from a previous assignment from one of my courses from my Master's porgram in Cybersecuity by Robert Morris University. In this assignment, I was presented a task to self analyze web application code and provide recomendations to modify the code in order to make it more secure and safe from common web attacks. 

The screenshot below is a copy of the code that I needed to analyze. This assignment had some common coding errors, I had circled two distinctive comments in red within the lines of code that could provide a hacker detailed information with how the lines of code operate to execute the program.

Circled in green is another coding error that some developers can make. If a developer names a code that may give information to link or database behind the code, in this case the code was "getSecretFormula."
